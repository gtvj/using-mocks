# Using mocks when testing Python

## Background

This quote from Testing Python: Applying Unit Testing, TDD, BDD and Acceptance Testing nicely summarises the role and purpose of test mocks:

> “When you write tests, you may discover that your code interacts with other systems that are assumed to be tested and fully functional, such as call a database or a web service. In these instances, you don’t want to make those calls for real in your test—for a number of reasons. For example, the database or web service **may be down** and you don’t want that to cause a failing test as part of your build process, which would produce a false positive. Also, those calls **may be slow** or cost your company money; therefore, if you are running a build every time you check in, your build could get lengthy or cost the company a large bill. This is where mocking and patching come in. They enable you to **swap those real calls for dummy responses**. This allows you to test that your code behaves as expected under those conditions”

## The code we do/don't want to test

There are two classes involved: 

* `my_module` - which has a dependency on `third_party_module`
* `libraries/third_party_module` - which makes an API call before returning an instance

Each of these has a descriptive comment.

The code can be run from `main.py`

### Using mocks to remove reliance upon third_party_module

`Mock` from [unittest.mock](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock) is used to create an two mocked objects
for our tests: 

* One that represents the 'happy path' - where we're getting back the string we expect
* One that is used to show that our code can handle a `None` response.
